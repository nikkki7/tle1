Since beginning of 2020, cases rose up to almost 500, 000 and death toll of 10, 000.<br> 
The Philippines is also preparing to purchase the COVID 19 vaccine just as they make sure enough supply would suffice the population.<br> 
However, last December, a new COVID strain has been discovered and detected in United Kingdom.<br> 
It is believed to spread faster than the COVID 19 virus thus bringing much fear to the public.<br> 
To our dismay, one of the returning OFWs has been detected with the said infection and was urgently quarantined.<br> 
All these given situation, the country still eagers to fight the battle against this invisible enemy and our part is to be a  disciplined citizen we can be.</u></b></p></font><br>
